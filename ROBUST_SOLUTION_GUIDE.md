# Robust Grid Alignment Solution

## Problem Analysis
The original issue was that grids were appearing outside ArUco markers and floating in the air. This was caused by:
1. **Poor homography quality** - The homography matrix wasn't computed robustly
2. **Inadequate marker detection** - Basic ArUco detection wasn't reliable enough
3. **Coordinate system inconsistencies** - Mismatched coordinate transformations
4. **No boundary constraints** - Grid wasn't constrained to marker area

## New Robust Approach

### Key Improvements:
1. **Quality-based homography computation** with validation
2. **Robust ArUco detection** with improved parameters
3. **Boundary constraint system** that limits grid to marker area
4. **Comprehensive validation** of homography quality
5. **Real-time marker tracking** for dynamic boundary updates

## Files Created:

### Core Components:
- `robust_mapping.py` - New mapping class with boundary constraints
- `robust_visualize.py` - Visualization functions that respect boundaries
- `robust_calibrate.py` - Improved calibration with quality assessment
- `robust_server.py` - Server using the robust approach
- `diagnose_homography.py` - Diagnostic tool for troubleshooting

### Test Scripts:
- `test_robust_solution.py` - Test the new solution
- `test_grid_alignment.py` - Test original approach (for comparison)

## How to Use:

### 1. First, run the diagnostic tool:
```bash
python diagnose_homography.py
```
This will analyze your current homography and show what's wrong.

### 2. Run robust calibration:
```bash
python robust_calibrate.py --save --quality-threshold 0.8
```
- Place your 4 ArUco markers in corners
- Wait for quality to reach 0.8+ (shown in status)
- Press 'c' to capture when ready
- Press 'q' to quit and save

### 3. Test the solution:
```bash
python test_robust_solution.py
```
- Press 'd' to toggle debug mode
- Press 's' to save test images
- Press 'q' to quit

### 4. Run the robust server:
```bash
python robust_server.py
```

## Expected Results:
- ✅ Grid lines appear ONLY within ArUco marker boundaries
- ✅ Grid is properly aligned to the ground
- ✅ Lava tiles are constrained to grid cells
- ✅ Real-time marker boundary tracking
- ✅ Quality validation prevents poor homographies

## Troubleshooting:

### If grids still appear outside markers:
1. **Check marker quality**: Ensure markers are flat, well-lit, and not wrinkled
2. **Improve lighting**: Use even lighting without shadows
3. **Increase quality threshold**: Use `--quality-threshold 0.9`
4. **Check marker size**: Markers should be large enough (at least 10cm)
5. **Verify marker placement**: Markers should form a proper rectangle

### If homography quality is low:
1. **Re-run calibration** with better lighting
2. **Check marker detection**: Ensure all 4 markers are clearly visible
3. **Adjust camera position**: Camera should be perpendicular to the floor
4. **Use higher resolution**: Increase camera resolution in config.yaml
